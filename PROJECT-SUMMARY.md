# n8n MCP Server - Project Summary

## ‚úÖ Project Completed Successfully!

Your n8n MCP (Model Context Protocol) server has been successfully created and is ready to use with Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible AI tools.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Built

### Core Components
- **MCP Server** (`src/index.ts`) - Main server implementation
- **n8n API Client** (`src/lib/n8n-client.ts`) - Complete n8n REST API integration
- **Workflow Tools** (`src/tools/workflow-tools.ts`) - AI tools for workflow management
- **Execution Tools** (`src/tools/execution-tools.ts`) - AI tools for execution monitoring
- **Credential Tools** (`src/tools/credential-tools.ts`) - AI tools for credential management
- **Resource Handlers** (`src/resources/resource-handlers.ts`) - MCP resource endpoints

### Available MCP Tools

#### Workflow Management
- `list_workflows` - List all workflows with filtering
- `get_workflow` - Get detailed workflow information
- `create_workflow` - Create workflows from natural language descriptions
- `update_workflow` - Update existing workflows and add nodes
- `delete_workflow` - Delete workflows (with confirmation)
- `activate_workflow` / `deactivate_workflow` - Control workflow execution

#### Execution Management
- `list_executions` - List workflow executions with filtering
- `get_execution` - Get detailed execution information
- `delete_execution` - Delete execution records
- `get_workflow_executions` - Get executions for specific workflows
- `get_execution_summary` - Get execution statistics

#### Credential Management
- `list_credentials` - List all configured credentials
- `get_credential` - Get credential information (data excluded for security)
- `create_credential` - Create new credentials
- `update_credential` - Update existing credentials
- `delete_credential` - Delete credentials
- `get_credential_types` - List available credential types

### MCP Resources
- `n8n://workflows` - JSON resource with all workflows
- `n8n://executions` - JSON resource with recent executions
- `n8n://credentials` - JSON resource with credentials (data excluded)
- `n8n://status` - JSON resource with instance health status

## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once configured with Claude Desktop, you can interact with n8n using natural language:

```
"List my n8n workflows"
"Create a workflow that sends an email when I receive a webhook"
"Show me the recent executions for my data sync workflow"
"Add a Slack notification node to workflow ID abc123"
"What credentials are configured in my n8n instance?"
"Activate the workflow called 'Daily Reports'"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file with your n8n instance details:
```env
N8N_API_URL=http://localhost:5678/api/v1
N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key_here
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["D:\\Dev\\n8n-api-mcp\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "N8N_API_URL": "http://localhost:5678/api/v1",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your_n8n_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop
After configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for core functionality
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type safety throughout
- ‚úÖ Build verification successful
- ‚úÖ Basic integration tests

Run tests with: `npm test`

## üìö Documentation

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `docs/claude-desktop-setup.md` - Detailed Claude Desktop configuration
- `test-server.ps1` - PowerShell script for testing and setup verification

## üîß Development Commands

```powershell
npm run build      # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run dev        # Development mode with file watching
npm start          # Start the production server
npm test           # Run the test suite
npm run lint       # Lint the code
npm run type-check # Type checking without compilation
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up your n8n API key** in the `.env` file
2. **Configure Claude Desktop** with the provided configuration
3. **Start using natural language** to manage your n8n workflows!

The MCP server is production-ready and follows all MCP specification guidelines. It provides a complete interface to your n8n instance through AI-powered natural language commands.

**Happy automating! ü§ñ‚ú®**
